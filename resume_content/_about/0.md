Full-stack developer, project manager, and founder. More than 10 years of experience building complex Web applications in companies like The Financial Times and Polygon. I developed great foundations at the start of my career giving me the flexibility to learn new tools extremely fast. I work best by building great relationships with my peers that result in greater collaboration.
